# DFT Workflows for Altermagnetic Materials

This repository contains DFT workflows and analysis tools for studying **altermagnetic materials** as part of my MSc thesis at IIT Hyderabad.

## Tools Used
- Quantum ESPRESSO (via ASE)
- Pymatgen, Spglib, Seekpath
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- AiiDA (planned for automation)

## Getting Started

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dft-altermag
